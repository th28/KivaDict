# KivaDict
An open source, ad-free Finnish dictionary for Android. The word data comes from parsing [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) word data provided by Tatu Ylonen's [wiktextract](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract). Definitely a work in progress! Currently only basic two-way English/Finnish search is implemented. The overall structure of the application attemptes to follow (for better or for worse) Google's reccommended MVVM app architecture. Wikitionary data is distributed on the basis of the [GNU Free Document License](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License).
