# KivaDict
An open source, ad-free Finnish dictionary for Android. The word data comes from parsing [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) word data provided by Tatu Ylonen's [wiktextract](https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract). Definitely a work in progress! Currently only basic two-way english/finnish search is implemented.
